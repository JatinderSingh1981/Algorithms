		Task Of Pairing

		A company sells dumbells in pairs. These are weights for exercising.
		They receive a shipment of dumbells weighing anywhere from 1 unit upto a certain maximum.
		A pair can only be sold if their weights are sufficiently close no greater than 1 unit of difference.
		Given an inventory of various weights, determine the maximum number of pairs the company can sell.

		For e.g., if there are 2 dumbells of weight 1, 4 of weight 2,
		3 of weight 3 and 1 of weight 4,
		they can only be paired as [1,1],[2,2],[2,2],[3,3],[3,4] for a toal of 5 pairs.
